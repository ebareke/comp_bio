## Advanced Linux concepts include:

1. Linux kernel: The Linux kernel is the core of a Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing system resources, including CPU, memory, and I/O.

2. System call: A system call is a request made by a user-level process to the kernel to perform a specific function. For example, the "open" system call is used to open a file.

3. Interprocess communication (IPC): IPC is the communication between two or more processes, allowing them to exchange data and synchronize their actions. There are several methods of IPC in Linux, including pipes, message queues, and shared memory.

4. Shell: The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. Some popular shells in Linux include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

5. File system: A file system is the way that an operating system organizes and stores files on a storage device. Linux supports many different file systems, including ext4, XFS, and NTFS.

6. Process management: Process management refers to the way that the operating system handles the execution of programs. Linux provides tools for starting, stopping, and managing processes, including the "top" and "ps" commands.

7. Networking: Linux includes a wide range of tools for configuring and managing network connections, including the "ifconfig" and "ip" commands for managing network interfaces, and the "route" command for managing routing tables.

8. Security: Linux includes a number of security features, including support for file permissions, user and group management, and firewall configuration.


## File permissions

In Linux, file permissions refer to the access rights that users and groups have to files and directories. There are three types of file permissions: read, write, and execute.

Read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or directory.

Write permission allows a user to modify the contents of a file or directory.

Execute permission allows a user to execute a file or traverse a directory.

File permissions are represented by a series of digits and letters. The first digit represents the permissions for the owner of the file, the second digit represents the permissions for the group owner of the file, and the third digit represents the permissions for all other users.

Here is an example of how to set file permissions using the `chmod` command:

```
chmod 755 filename
```

This command sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for everyone else for the file `filename`.

Here is a breakdown of the permissions set by the `chmod 755` command:

* 7 - This sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner. The digits are made up of the sum of the permissions:
  * read (4) + write (2) + execute (1) = 7
* 5 - This sets read and execute permissions for the group owner and all other users. The digits are made up of the sum of the permissions:
  * read (4) + execute (1) = 5

You can also use symbolic notation to set file permissions. For example, the following command sets the same permissions as `chmod 755`:

```
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx filename
```

This command sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (`u` stands for "user"), read and execute permissions for the group owner (`g` stands for "group"), and read and execute permissions for all other users (`o` stands for "other").
